# 1 Dijkstra Algorithm

Implementation of the Dijkstra Algorithm for a Point Robot

Find all the possible 8 connected neighbors and subsequent nodes of those neighbors along with backtracking and visualization

## Python File 
```
It is stored in the directory proj2_Shail_Kiritkumar_Shah.zip / dijkstra_shail_kiritkumar_shah.py
```
## Running the code
There are four ways of running a python script which are as follows:

 - You may run it in your operating system's terminal. For e.g., In windows - cmd.
 - Python interactive mode.
 - Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSC.
 - Opening the script file from folder

First check the version of python installed in your system by running following command:

*python --version*

If it yields result like this one:

*Python 3.8.10*

Then you may run script in terminal by typing following line in the directory it is located at:

*python3 dijkstra_shail_kiritkumar_shah.py*

## Dependencies

import following modules/library for the script to run correctly: 

*import  numpy as np*  			

*import cv2 as cv*  								

*from queue import PriorityQueue*  								

*import math as m*  								

*import time as tm*  								

## User input

Defining user defined initial & goal node in following format:
```
Enter starting coordinates: 6 6
Enter goal coordinates: 500 200
```
The elements are to be entered one after another and with a space separator/delimiter.
Kindly provide the input from your terminal and in the format it is explained above for correct implementation

The output file of video will be generated at the directory path your terminal is located at.
